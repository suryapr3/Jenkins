This readme expains the process For opening a socket from matlab reading and writing register/memory content from hawkcrest model downloaded in FRIO

scripts used in FRIO env 
    -  server.py
scripts sourced in matlab
    - open_tcp_socket.m
    - frio_readreg.m
    - frio_writereg.m

flow
   1. Download the design in FRIO
   2. source srp
   3. start the server in austin on host connected to FRIO (python3 server.py)
   4. note down the server ip addr and port no
   5. start the matlab on your laptop/Santa Clara, where matlab licence is available 
   6. open the socket using open_tcp_socket ( use the ip addr, and port no which you noted in step 4)
   7. use the frio_readreg, frio_readwrite functions for reading/writing the memory register in 4 bytes chunks
