This test aims to validate the 'm_rcs_0' port of the NoC by initiating WRITE and READ access to the target ports. The process involves the following steps:

1)The GPDMA writes to and reads from the target registers.
2)The read data is copied to an RSM memory buffer.
3)Upon receiving a COMPLETION handshake from the RCS core, the HOST compares the contents of the RSM memory buffer against the expected register values.

This test ensures that the 'm_rcs_0' port of the NoC can correctly write to and read from the target registers.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python targets_write_read_test.py <rcs_core> <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : This is the RCS core number who'll initiate access via m_rcs_0 port.
                        This argument can take values 0 or 1 or 2 for LX7 Ax or LX7 Rx or LX7 Tx respectively.
        <pattern>     : This the pattern that user wants to write in the target register.
How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
