This test aims to validate the 'm_rcs_0' port of the NoC by initiating WRITE and READ access to the RBM registers of the connected target ports. The process involves the following steps:

1. The GPDMA writes a pattern to the target RBM registers.
2. Immediately after, the GPDMA reads the data from the target RBM registers.
3. The read data is copied to an RSM memory buffer.
4. Upon receiving a COMPLETION handshake from the RCS core, the HOST compares the contents of the RSM memory buffer against the expected register values.

This test ensures that the 'm_rcs_0' port of the NoC can correctly write to and read from the RBM registers of the target ports.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python rbm_registers_write_read_test.py <rcs_core> <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : This is the RCS core number who'll initiate access via m_rcs_0 port.
                        This argument can take values 0 or 1 or 2 for LX7 Ax or LX7 Rx or LX7 Tx respectively.
        <pattern>     : This is the pattern which is to be written to the target RBM register via m_rcs0 port.
How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
