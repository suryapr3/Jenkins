This is a negative test where in first, using an RCS core we will changing  the  address mask register that enable m_rcs_0 ports's
access to target address space. Then we will let GPDMA to read from this target space. As the GPDMA's access is also via m_rcs_0,
this access should get blocked. So in this test, we are validating whether that access is getting blocked by changing  the
address mask register or not.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python access_check_changing_default_base_address_register.py <rcs_core>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : This is the RCS core number who'll initiate access via m_rcs_0 port.
                        This argument can take values 0 or 1 or 2 for LX7 Ax or LX7 Rx or LX7 Tx respectively.
        <pattern>     : This the input pattern the pcie host writes to the target registers

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
