This test aims to validate the 'm_rcs_0' port of the NoC by initiating READ access to the RBM registers of the
connected target ports. The RCS core is made to read from the target RBM registers and are copied on to an RSM
memory buffer. The HOST upon receiving a COMPLETION handshake from the RCS core, compares the contents of the
RSM memory against the default register values.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python default_rbm_register_read_test.py <rcs_core>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : This is the RCS core number who'll initiate access via m_rcs_0 port.
                        This argument can take values 0 or 1 or 2 for LX7 Ax or LX7 Rx or LX7 Tx respectively.

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
