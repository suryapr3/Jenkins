************************************************************/

This test aims to validate the 'm_rcs_0' port of the NoC by initiating WRITE/READ access to the RBM registers of the connected target ports.
The RCS core is made to write a pattern and then read from the target RBM registers immediately and are copied on to an RSM memory buffer.
The HOST upon receiving a COMPLETION handshake from the RCS core, compares the contents of the RSM memory against the default register values.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python rbm_registers_write_read_test.py <rcs_core> <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : This is the RCS core number who'll initiate access via m_rcs_0 port.
                        This argument can take values 0 or 1 or 2 for LX7 Ax or LX7 Rx or LX7 Tx respectively.
        <pattern>     : This is the pattern which is to be written to the target RBM register via m_rcs0 port.
How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
