************************************************************/

This test aims to validate the 'm_drf_0' port of the NoC by initiating WRITE/READ access to the target ports.
The DRF DMA is made to write and read from the target registers and are copied on to an RSM memory buffer.
The HOST upon receiving a COMPLETION handshake from the RCS core, compares the contents of the
RSM memory against the default register values.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python targets_write_read_test.py <rcs_core> <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : This is the RCS core number who'll initiate access via m_rcs_0 port.
                        This argument can take values 0 or 1 or 2 for  Ax or  Rx or  Tx respectively.
        <pattern>     : This the pattern that user wants to write in the target register.
How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
