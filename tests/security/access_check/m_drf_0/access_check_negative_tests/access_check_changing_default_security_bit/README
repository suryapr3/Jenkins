This is a negative test where in first, using an RCS core we will set Non-secure bit of base address rbm register that enable
m_drf_0 ports's access to target address space. Then we will let DRF DMA to read from this target space. As the DRF DMA's access
is also via m_drf_0,this access should get blocked. So in this test, we are validating whether that access is getting
blocked by changing the security bit or not.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python access_check_changing_default_base_address_register.py <rcs_core>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : This is the RCS core number who'll initiate access via m_rcs_0 port.
                        This argument can take values 0 or 1 or 2 for LX7 Ax or LX7 Rx or LX7 Tx respectively.
        <pattern>     : This the input pattern the pcie host writes to the target registers

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
