***********************************************************************/
This is a negative test case where m_cs_dbg is made to access the NoC targets after modifying the default security bit of base
address rbm register corresponding to that target in the RBM register space of the m_cs_dbg bridge. This test aims to validate
the m_cs_dbg port of the NoC by initiating access to the target ports. By default, the base address register's NS bit will be '0'
, we modify this bit to '1' so that the access via m_cs_dbg will pass through. However, in this test we will set this bit to '0'
so that the access will be blocked.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python access_check_changing_default_base_address_register.py <rcs_core>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : The LX7 Cores 0, 1 or 2 for modifying the security bit of rbm register.
        <pattern>     : This the pattern that user wants to write in the target register.

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
