This is a negative test case where m_cs_dbg is made to access the NoC targets after modifying the default base address register
corresponding to that target in the RBM register space of the m_cs_dbg bridge. This test aims to validate the m_cs_dbg port of
the NoC by initiating access to the target ports. By default, the base address register will be pointing to the address space of
the target, where in the access via m_cs_dbg will pass through. However, in this test this base address register will be modified
to any pattern so that any access to that target address space should be blocked. So in this test, we're validating
whether that access is blocked or not.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python access_check_changing_default_base_address_register.py <rcs_core>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : The LX7 Cores 0, 1 or 2 for modifying the security bit and base address of rbm register.
        <pattern>     : This the pattern that user wants to write in the target register.

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
