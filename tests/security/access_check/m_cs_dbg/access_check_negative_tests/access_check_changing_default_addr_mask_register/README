This is a negative test case where m_cs_dbg host is made to access the NoC targets after modifying the default address mask
register corresponding to that target in the RBM register space of the m_cs_dbg bridge. By default, the address mask register
contains a value which decides the address range of the target. So, the address mask register is corrupted such that the
the m_cs_dbg bridge access is denied to the last register address of the target.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python access_check_changing_default_addr_mask_register.py <rcs_core> <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : The LX7 Cores 0, 1 or 2 for modifying the security bit and addr mask of rbm register.
        <pattern>     : This the pattern that user wants to write in the target register.

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
