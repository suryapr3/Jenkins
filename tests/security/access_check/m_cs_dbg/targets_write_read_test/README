This test aims to validate the m_cs_dbg port of the NoC by initiating WRITE/READ operations to the target ports. By default,
the m_cs_dbg port is non-secure and the targets are secured, as indicated by the non-secure bit in the RBM registers being 0.
To facilitate access to these targets by the m_cs_dbg port, the Non secure bit must be set to 1 in the RBM registers. Then
m_cs_dbg APIs are used to WRITE/READ the targets, and get result as PASS/FAIL based on comparison between actual value and
expected value.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python targets_write_read_test.py <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : The LX7 Cores 0, 1 or 2 for modifying the security bit of rbm register.
        <pattern>     : This the pattern that user wants to write in the target register.

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
