This is a negative test case where in pcie host is made to access the NoC targets after modifying the default
base address register corresponding to that target in the RBM register space of the m_pcie bridge.By default,
the base address register will be pointing to the address space of the target, where in the access via pcie
will pass through. However, in this test, the security bit of this base address register will be modified to 1
so that any access to that target address space should be blocked. So in this test, we're validating whether
that access is blocked or not.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python access_check_changing_default_security_bit.py <rcs_core> <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : This is the RCS core number who'll initiate access via m_rcs_0 port.
                        This argument can take values 0 or 1 or 2 for LX7 Ax or LX7 Rx or LX7 Tx respectively.
        <pattern>     : This the input pattern the pcie host writes to the target registers

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
