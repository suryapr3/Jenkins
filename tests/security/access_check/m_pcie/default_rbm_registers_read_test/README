This test aims to validate the 'm_pcie' port of the NoC by initiating READ access to the RBM registers of the
connected target ports. The pcie host is by default secure, but in security the master pcie is supposed to be
non-secure. Therefore, we need to enable the security by setting the "pcie_master_axim_override_bypass_disable"
bit before running the testcase. Then pcie host is made to read from the target RBM registers, compares the
actual value against the default values.

How to enable security ?
    frioPciWrite -F s6b1 -P 0x20000 0x050

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python default_rbm_register_read_test.py

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
