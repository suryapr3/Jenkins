************************************************************/
This test aims to validate the 'm_pcie' port of the NoC by initiating WRITE/READ access to
the target ports. The pcie host is by default secure, but in security the master pcie is supposed to be
non-secure. Therefore, we can also enable the security by setting the "pcie_master_axim_override_bypass_disable"
bit before running the testcase. Then pcie host is made to write the target registers and compares the value
against the default values.

How to enable security ?
    frioPciWrite -F s6b1 -P 0x20000 0x050

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python targets_write_read_test.py <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <pattern>     : This the pattern that user wants to write in the target register.

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
