This is a negative test case where in KP1 core is made to access the NoC targets after modifying
the default base address register corresponding to that target in the RBM register space of the m_rcs1 bridge.
By default, the base address register will be pointing to the address space of the target, where in the access
via m_rcs_1 will pass through. However, in this test, the security bit of this base address register will be modified
to 1 so that any access to that target address space should be blocked. So in this test, we're validating whether
that access is blocked or not.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python access_check_changing_default_security_bit.py <rcs_core> <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : This is the RCS core number who'll initiate access via m_rcs_1 port.
                        This argument can take value 3 KP1 CAL respectively.
        <pattern>     : This the input pattern the rcs writes to the target registers

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
