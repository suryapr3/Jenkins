*********************************************************************/
This is a negative test case where m_syscon_1 is made to access the NoC targets after modifying the default security bit of base
address rbm register corresponding to that target in the RBM register space of the m_syscon_1 bridge. This test aims to validate
the m_syscon_1 port of the NoC by initiating access to the target ports. By default, the base address register's NS bit will be '0'
, we modify this bit to '1' so that the access via m_syscon_1 will pass through. After that we will set this bit to '0' so that the
access will be blocked as all targets become secure.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python access_check_changing_default_security_bit.py <rcs_core> <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <rcs_core>    : This is the RCS core number who'll initiate access via m_rcs_0 port.
                        This argument can take values 0 or 1 or 2 for LX7 Ax or LX7 Rx or LX7 Tx respectively.
        <pattern>     : This the input pattern the pcie host writes to the target registers

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
