This test aims to validate the 'm_syscon_0' port of the NoC by initiating WRITE/READ access from SPI_EXT to the RBM
registers of the connected target ports. The SPI host is made to write to the target RBM registers, compares the actual
value against the default values.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python rbm_registers_write_read_test.py <rcs_core> <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <pattern>     : This is the pattern which is to be written to the target RBM register via m_syscon_0 port.

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
