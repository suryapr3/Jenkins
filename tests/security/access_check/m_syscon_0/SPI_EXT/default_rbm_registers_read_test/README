This test aims to validate the 'm_syscon_0' port of the NoC by initiating READ access from SPI_EXT to the RBM registers
of the connected target ports. Then SPI host is made to read from the target RBM registers, compares the actual value
against the default values.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python default_rbm_register_read_test.py

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
