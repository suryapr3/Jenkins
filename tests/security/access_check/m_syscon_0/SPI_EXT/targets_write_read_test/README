************************************************************/
This test aims to validate the 'm_syscon_0' port of the NoC by initiating WRITE/READ access from SPI_EXT to
the target ports.  The SPI is made to write and read the target registers and compares the value against the
default values.

How to run the test ?
    From any ABC FRIO bash terminal, execute the following.
    python targets_write_read_test.py <pattern>

    @input arguments
        <pattern>     : This the pattern that user wants to write in the target register.

How to check the output ?
    Upon completion of the test, PASS/FAIL status will be displayed in the bash terminal.
    Additionally, the same can be confirmed from the log file generated from the serial console.

Errors if any ?
    Take a look at the serial log so generated and grep for string "ERROR". Triage it depending upon the
    nature of the ERROR logged.
