Bit Field Description,,,"num of samples at input to MOD (for DL) or DMOD (for UL), this can be used by SWG configuration for num of polyphases. 0 means input sample rate is lower than mix_rate",,,"optional mod/demod rate, value e_VHA_NO_MIX=6 indicating no mod/demod used(if input_rate for DDC or output_rate for DUC is less than min SWG rate 983.04/1474.56MSPS). mix_rate almost always the same as high_rate",,,"for DUC, this is the sample rate of the data present in the downlink band 0/1 input FIFO, this must be set correctly so that the VHA circuitry extracts data for the respective band correctly, if the VHA_DUC is being used, this must be programmed to match its input rate. for DDC, this is the sample rate of the data at the output of the VHA_DDC",,,"for VHA_DDC, this is the sample rate of the data present in the UL input FIFO, if vha_dmod is being used, this cannot be any less than VHA_RATE_1, if dmod is bypassed, this can take any legal rate; for VHA_DUC, This is the sample rate out of bank 0/1 of vha_duc, Note that if vha_mod is being used, this cannot be any less than VHA_RATE_1.",,,"Manual filter stage selection bits. 
These bits determine which filter stages are active when MODE is 1. When a STAGE_ACTIVE bit is 1, corresponding filter stage is active, otherwise it is bypassed(low to high: w1 to w4)",,,,,,,,,,
