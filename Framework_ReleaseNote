   o  included srp header files
   o  read_reg, write_reg, read_write_reg APIs are added, these APIs uses block id, index and offset for initiating any read/write transaction 
   o  added the block id, index, offset information while logging the mismatch if any
2. init.c
   o included srp header files
   o srp function for opening the controller ( required for initiating any controller read/write transaction using RTE functions)
3. hw_inc_rte
   o added the controller header files from RTE
4. FPGA.env and fpga_setup.config
   o setup file
5. tests/temp/temp.py
   o should be used as reference for developing script for test
   o updates for naming log file for c test execution
6. tests/temp/Makefile
   o should be used as reference for developing script for test
   o updates for using RTE shared libraries
   o updates for using RTE header files


steps to run tests using framework
1. checkout the emul validation firmware in the santa clara
    /p/hdk/bin/cth_psetup -p abc -cfg HWCFE -read_only
2. copy it to austing using scp command
3. workspace should be the directory where FPGA.env,fpga_setup.sh is kept
4. creat rundir
5. cd into rundir
6. start the frio
7. once frio window is popped up, cd to workspace area
8. switch to bash
9. if you want to use RTE header files, update python.env ( export RTE_HEADER=1)
10. source FPGA.env
11. now setup is ready
12. create tests in test directory
13. use tests/temp/temp.py and tests/temp/Makefile as reference for creating your own tests
